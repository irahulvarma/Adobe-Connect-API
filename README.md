# Adobe-Connect-API

This is one of the library I created during one of my project. Hope this helps others when implementing Adobe Connect in their web application.

Note : While creating user, I am using default password that is set in private variable $_user_password. 
Also redirection, I am using the password auto login to the meeting.

There is a possibility of resetting the password by the user to different password other than $_user_password. 
In that case reset password will be helpful in resetting to $_user_password.

Here you can perform the following operations through this Adobe Connect Libary:
  1) Create webinar 
  2) Add attendees 
  3) Create User in Adobe Connect
  4) List Attendees
  5) List Meetings
  6) List User Meetings
  7) Adding access to user
  8) Delete meeting
  9) Set Timezone of the user
  10) Get recorded Archives through meeting id
  11) Reset password
  12) Redirect URL
